# Project
A kiosk inside a Raspberry Pi 3 with 7" touch screen visible at Lausanne's Liip office.

# Goals
- Display the dashboard web interface of the Smappee device located inside the office.
- Environnement friendly (HDMI, USB, LAN ports are disabled, 50% of backlight)
- - Will improve this with utilisation timer, dim to 10% if no user since 5 minutes input and up to 100% when user input.
- Open Source
- Hackable

# Access
In `liipguest` you can connect you into ssh with:

> `$ ssh pi@10.0.5.229`

pwd: `pi`

# Thanks
- Liip for the opportunity, time and the device.
